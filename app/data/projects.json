I've always been interested in options pricing, growing up playing with options volatility, and love the math behind different pricing models. Hudson River Trading has a lot of articles of things you can do with gRPC servers. For this project, I built a gRPC server that can price options using multiple pricing models. I used the Black-Scholes model, the Heston model, and the Variance Gamma model. I'm not really sold on Black-Scholes, as volatility tends to be dynamic and random.",

Unfortunately, with being a full time student athlete, recruiting for internships (Leetcode please save me), running TouredIt (We had marketing interns!), and launching the Tufts Free Food Module, I could not keep up with the content and had to stop. Many of the people we started along with have now become so massive. As much as I hate to admit it, watching our competitor, Flyhysteria, grow from 1000 to 78k followers was a fun experience. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to top consitently getting 3000 likes on a post.",

I built a sentiment analysis tool that scrapes Twitter data about the Philadelphia Union, analyzes the sentiment of the tweets, and displays the results in a dashboard. It parallizes it with recent news articles and match results about the Philadelphia Union to give a holistic view of the team's sentiment. I also tracked the rate of change in twitter sentiment, with cron jobs to text my cellphone if there was a significant change. The idea is that Sports Traders could have an advantage on betting lines before the market moves the line. Unfortunately, this was around when Twitter turned to X, and nuked their developers portal + any scraping ability, so this project became deprecated.",
