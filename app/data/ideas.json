    "description": "Let's be clear. AI is the future. AI is the future due to accessibility of infromation. NOT because you can automate everything with an AI agent and replace all workers. God, I see so much doom-fantasy online about how AI will take our jobs. It won't. It's statistical autocomplete. With that being said, AI will greatly transform education. Most students use it now anyways to learn. Why not govern and build a tool that can analyze someones conversation with AI to see if they're using it for their benefit by delaying gratification and using it to help them digest concepts + apply learning or simply just trying to be lazy and have a model do all their work. A tool like this can rapidly transform the education system, allowing incredible learning and innovation. It can also be used by companies for hiring, such as leetcode style interviews, or analysis of coding agent use in junior devs, etc."
